Seiichi was harshly interrogated during six weeks of detention and died just a day after he was released in January 1942.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following month, President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin D.

Like other Japanese families, the Nakaharas were forced to give up their livelihoods and possessions, and the family spent three years at an internment camp in Jerome, Arkansas. She would later describe herself as “apolitical” before the war.

She and dozens of others were detained by police, and while she was waiting in the courthouse, she saw Malcolm X arrive to give his support to the predominately Black group of protesters. Initially reluctant to intrude on what she considered an important encounter for the Black youth in the group, she eventually worked up the courage to introduce herself. As she would later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/us/yuri-kochiyama-civil-rights-activist-dies-at-93.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=recall class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">recall</a>, she told him she admired his work but disagreed with his opposition to racial segregation, which had made him a controversial outlier to the more mainstream civil rights movement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perhaps impressed by her willingness to challenge his positions, Malcolm and Kochiyama soon bonded.
