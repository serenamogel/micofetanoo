Co-Owner and Wife of John Henry</h1><div id=sub-header>March 2024 · 6 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>Linda Pizzuti is a great success.&nbsp;She’s an amazing businesswoman and real estate developer.&nbsp;Over the past two decades, the hardworking woman has gone from her beginnings in real estate development to owning and overseeing some of the greatest institutions in the Boston area and beyond.</span></p><p><span>Pizzuti was already self-taught before meeting her husband, billionaire businessman</span><span>&nbsp;John W. Henry&nbsp;</span><span>, the co-founder of the infamous sports management company, Fenway Sports Group.&nbsp;Fenway owns the MLB franchise with multiple World Series victories, the Boston Red Sox, and historic Premier League football club Liverpool.&nbsp;Pizzuti is also a shareholder of Fenway as well as a film producer, managing director of&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Boston Globe</span></i><span>&nbsp;and many more.</span></p><h2><b><span>The biography of Linda Pizzuti</span></b></h2><p><span>The American businesswoman was born on September 20, 1978, in Lynnfield, Massachusetts.&nbsp;Her father, Don Pizzuti, is an Italian immigrant who made his living as a real estate developer and engineer.&nbsp;His mother, Maria Pizzuti, was a housewife.</span></p><p><span>For her education, Pizzuti attended Babson College where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree.&nbsp;She then took a master’s degree in real estate development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was 26 when she graduated.</span></p><p><span>Linda has three older sisters and growing up, their father taught them the ropes of the real estate business.&nbsp;During this period, they worked in their father’s agency.&nbsp;After college, Linda helped grow her father’s agency until her personal endeavors and marriage won out.</span></p><p><span>Linda Pizzuti met John Henry on the night of June 6, 2008. Henry was immediately taken with her but she initially refused his advances, partly because John W. Henry was twice her age and also because his parents were opposed to the relationship.&nbsp;They finally gave their consent and she agreed to marry him.&nbsp;The couple</span><span>&nbsp;tied the knot on Henry’s yacht&nbsp;</span><span>in 2009 and the reception was held at Fenway Park.&nbsp;Some 400 guests attended, including friends, family and associates.</span></p><p><span>She has two children with Henry – a daughter named Sienna Henry and an unnamed son;&nbsp;She also has a stepdaughter, Sara, who comes from Henry’s last marriage to a woman named Peggy Sue.&nbsp;Pizzuti is Henry’s third marriage;&nbsp;Prior to marrying Peggy Sue, he was previously married to a woman named Mai Henry – his first wife.</span></p><p><span>To say that Linda Pizzuti has been a major part of Henry’s empire since their marriage is an understatement.&nbsp;For example, she used her property experience and connections to help Fenway Sports Group negotiate new land deals for the expansion of Anfield Stadium, home of Liverpool Football Club.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, when John Henry bought&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Boston Globe</span></i><span>&nbsp;back in 2013 for $70 million, he named Linda its managing director.&nbsp;Initially, many were unhappy with this decision and rightly so;&nbsp;for her part, Linda did not have the qualifications to fulfill her new role and believed that she had not obtained the position on merit.&nbsp;Her naysayers&nbsp;</span><span>since then, she has praised the commendable and transformative work she has done so far.&nbsp;</span><span>Linda Pizzuti is also more involved in the newspaper than Henry.</span></p><p><span>It also featured two flagship festivals – GlobeDocs, a documentary film festival, and HUBweek, aimed to showcase and celebrate cultural and industrial institutions in the Boston area.&nbsp;</span><span>The businesswoman is also the founder of a few charities and seed investment funds serving the Boston area.</span></p><h2><b><span>Facts About Red Sox Part-Owner and John Henry’s Wife</span></b></h2><h3><strong><span>1.
