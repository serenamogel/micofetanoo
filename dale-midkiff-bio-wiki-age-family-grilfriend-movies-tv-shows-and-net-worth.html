His first movie role was in Roger Corman’s Streetwalkin’ playing a pimp named Duke. Dale’s acting was called “grittily impressive” in what some consider a B-movie classic. He has said in interviews that while his family never quite understood his interest in acting, they never discouraged him: “I love them for allowing a kid to believe in his dreams.”</p><p>His first major break came when he landed the role of the young Jock Ewing in Dallas: The Early Years. That was followed by what many consider his biggest role to date, Elvis Presley, in the four-hour miniseries, Elvis and Me, and by Dream Street, a short-lived “blue-collar” series set in New Jersey. Midkiff’s roles have run the gamut from the wife-beater in A Cry For Help: The Tracey Thurman Story, to the “good old boy” cop who discovers his partner/best friend is a murderer in Vigilante Cop, to the heroic time-traveling fugitive retrieval cop in Time Trax, to the amiable ladies’ man and town protector in The Magnificent Seven. He is also well known for having played the lead role of Louis Creed in the 1989 film version of Stephen King’s Pet Sematary.</p><h1><span><span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Dale Midkiff</span></span></span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-dale></span><span><span><span>Who is Dale?</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dale Midkiff born as Dale Alan Midkiff is an American actor, best known for playing Louis Creed in the horror film Pet Sematary (1989) and Captain Darien Lambert in the TV series Time Trax.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-dale></span><span><span><span>How old is Dale?</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dale was born on July 1st, 1959 in Chance, Maryland, United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-dale></span><span><span><span>How tall is Dale?</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dale measures a standing height of 6 feet 2 inches tall which is equivalent to 1.88 meters tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-dale-married></span><span>Is Dale<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>married?</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Midkiff is currently married.
