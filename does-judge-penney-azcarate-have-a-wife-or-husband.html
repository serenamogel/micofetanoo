Her admirable demeanor during the trial led to questions about her personal life, which in turn, revealed that she is married to Eddy Azcarate.</p><p>Judge Penney is a chief judge at Fairfax Circuit Court in Virginia. She is also the chief judge of the 19th Judicial Circuit in Virginia since her appointment in February 25, 2015. She is expected to hold this position until June 30, 2023.</p><h2><strong>Who is the Husband Judge Penney Azcarate Married to?</strong></h2><p>Judge Penney Azcarate is happily married to a retired police officer identified as Eddy Azcarate. Twitter went wild with tweets about the judge when the Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard trial commenced. Many suggested that she might be married to a woman.</p><p>The records have now been set straight as we can confirm that Judge Penney is married to a man. The personal details about their love life, including when they met and the year they got married are not public knowledge. This doesn’t come as a surprise, considering the kind of work they do.</p><p>Despite the paucity of information available about their personal lives and journey as a couple, there are speculations that Eddy and Penney go way back to high school. They have reportedly known each other since high school at Bishop O’Connell High School.</p><p>According to Eddy’s <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> profile, the two attended Old Dominion University together. However, they chose different career paths and have done remarkably well in their individual endeavors. Eddy graduated with a degree in Business Administration and Management in 1989.</p><h2><strong>Judge Penney Azcarate’s Husband is a Retired Police Officer</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/1660915355314-e1672924382323.jpg><p>While Penney chose a career in law, her husband opted for a career in the police force. Before he joined the police force, Eddy worked as a service manager at Warner Plumbing in Northern Virginia. He left the plumbing industry when he joined the United States Marine Corps as a full-time Reservist.</p><p>His duties at the time comprised coordinating and preparing Riverine Training Teams for deployment in South America. Eddy Azcarate worked with servicemen from different branches, including the US Coast Guard.</p><p>A Facebook image shared by Eddy in November 2020 showed him in his military attire at Port Al Jubail where he was serving in 1990. Interestingly, Penney was also with the United States Marine Corps where she rose to the rank of Captain before going into her law career full-time.</p><p>Eddy Azcarate joined the police force before he retired from the marine as a major in 1999. He joined the Fairfax County Police as a Master Police Officer and spent 22 years and three months with the division before retiring in April 2022. Eddy now works in the Washington DC metro area as a Deputy Regional Security Advisor for the Secure Community Network.</p><h2><strong>Does Judge Penney Azcarate Have Children?</strong></h2><p>Judge Penney Azcarate has four children, and they are all adults. However, nothing is known about them in the public space. Their mother’s job makes it unsafe to bare their personal details in the media. As a result, we can only confirm that Judge Penney Azcarate has four children, but their names, identities, and what they have been up to are not public knowledge.</p><p>Online comments about Judge Penney during the 2022 trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp portray her as a terrific judge who has a wicked sense of humor. She was highly commended for her fairness to both sides.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCwzp6qZqKlmbSmec%2BepaedqWKuu6%2FAq5itnV2drrexjJpksKGWmnqwvoyhrKyakaOxcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./odell-beckham-jr-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Odell Beckham Jr. Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifesyle</a>
