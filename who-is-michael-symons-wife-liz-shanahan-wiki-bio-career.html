Wiki-Bio, Career, Children.</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael Symon may be one of the most renowned names in the culinary world, but he couldn’t have done it without the help of his wife, Liz Shanahan. Michael reached worldwide fame following his appearances on Food Network on shows such as Iron Chef America, Burgers, Brew and ‘Que, Food Feuds, and The Best Thing I Ever Ate, as well as Cook Like an Iron Chef on the Cooking Channel and The Chew on ABC. While Liz has decided to support her husband from the shadows, she continues to be an integral part of his success. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Liz Shanahan.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Early Life:</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Liz Shanahan was born on the 30th of March in the late 1960s. Born and raised in Georgia, USA, Liz has revealed very little about herself and is not a huge fan of the media. Little is known about Liz’s parents, ancestors, and early life. As far as academia goes, Liz is known to have graduated high school but decided against going to college. From a young age, Liz was interested in cooking and would often spend her free time in the kitchen.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/website-72.jpg><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career:</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After graduating high school, Liz began hunting for jobs in restaurants and took up several jobs in low ends restaurants. Determined to change her fortune, Liz was searching for a way to climb up the culinary ladder, which was how she met Michael. The pair were working at the same place and began dating soon after.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In February of 1997, Michael and Liz opened Lola in Cleveland’s trendy Tremont neighborhood. The restaurant received Rave views and was named one of America’s Best Restaurants in&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Gourmet</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;magazine in its October 2000 issue. In 2005, the pair converted Lola into Lolita and opened a second outlet in downtown Cleveland the next year.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Restaurant and other things:</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the huge success of Lola, the pair continued to orchestrate some of the leading restaurants across the nation. Over the years, Symon and Liz have started several restaurants including, Mabel’s BBQ, Lola, Lolita, Bar Symon, Roast, BSpot, and Angeline. While Symon acted as the face of the restaurant business, Liz helped Symon with business management. While the restaurants have gone on to become some of the bests restaurants around the states, Symon and Liz have kept the business in the family. During their early years, Simon’s father used to do the books of accounts, and his mother and mother-in-law used to answer the phones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Personal Life:</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael Symon is happily married to his wife Liz Shanahan. When the pair first met in the early 90s, Liz was already married and had a son Kyle. When Michael and Liz first met, Kyle was 2-years old and was a single mom. The pair began dating soon after and tied the knot on the 1st of November, 1998. While this is Liz’s second marriage, she is happy with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael</a> and claims that the pair have a great friendship. Talking to NY Times, Liz revealed,</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“This is my second marriage, but this is the first time I’ve been able to breathe. Michael is very chill and non-confrontational. When you’re around that, it gives you the ability to trust and gain confidence. We had a great friendship first and that helps because you learn to like the person you’re with. With Michael, I’ve learned I don’t always have to be right. I don’t always have to be first. And to have the confidence to admit when I’m wrong. That’s very beneficial.”</span></p><h2>Children:</h2><p>“Failures are part of life and one got to see past them,” and <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Liz Shanahan is a testament to the very statement. After the first failed marriage, Liz found solace in the arms of Michael Symon. The pair have been in conjugal relationships for over 24 years now. Not just a homemaker, Liz has been a big part of his restaurant business. In the years of togetherness as a married couple, the pair is yet to give birth to biological children. Their son Kyle Shanahan is from Liz’s first marriage.</span></p><h2>Kyle <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Shanahan & a new generation:</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kyle grew up under the care of Liz and Micheal and since has become independent. Kyle raises a family of his own with a wife and two children. It means Liz Shanahan and Michael Symon are grandparents.&nbsp; </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kyle is married to Krista Shanahan. The pair welcomed their first child, a baby girl Emmy Shanahan, in December 2018, and then a baby boy, Butch Shanahan in October 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Talking about his professional side of life, Kyle is a business owner and successfully running Grindstone Coffee & Donuts since 2016. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We can see where he gets inspiration to get into the culinary world, not to mention his stepfather Michael Symon.</span></p><h2>Net Worth:</h2><p>Liz <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Shanahan has successfully shown she is more than a homemaker. Liz has been a big part of family restaurant business, although not the face, she has helped her husband to manage restaurants for many years now. There is no separate account of Liz’s earnings or net worth. As for her husband, Michael Symon has a net worth of $6M.</span></p><h2>A quick overview of Michael Symon:</h2><p>Michael Symon is a chef, restaurateur, and television personality from Cleveland, Ohio.
